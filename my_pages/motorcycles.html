        <h1>My Motorcycles</h1>
        <p class="musicp">I really like motorcycles. I have a couple, and will probably go through a couple more in the future. Below I talk about the two I currently have, as well as some others I've enjoyed riding..</p>

                    <p>I bought this bike for $200 on kind of a whim. I'd been on a dirt bike exactly once before and had never actually driven one. My older brother saw it for sale while visiting a friend and told me if I didn't buy it he was going to. So I used half of my first paycheck of a new job and bought it. Had to put some work into it, but it runs alright nowadays. I'm hoping to take it out soon!</p>

                    <p>The first road bike I rode was the same year and model, just a 1500cc. It was awesome. So last year when I decided I wanted to buy a road bike of my own, I got the same make and model. It's really fun to ride, albeit a little uncomfortable. I'm planning on getting some taller handle bars and am currently remaking one of the seats I have for it. I don't think I'll keep this one forever, but it defintely has been a good starter bike.</p>

                    <p>I've ridden on a few other bikes. The green one below is a 60cc bike, made for kids, but it's almost more fun to ride than any other bike! I have yet to ride a sportsbike, and I really want to try one sometime.</p>
