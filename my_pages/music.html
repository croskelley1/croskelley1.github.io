        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p class="musicp">I've always enjoyed playing music. I started piano when I was 6 but didn't stick with it, much to my regret. I learned French Horn and Trumpet in junior high, as well as started choir then. I didn't play in band in high school, but continued singing.</p>
        <p class="musicp">Two years ago I bought a trumpet to pick it up again. Earlier this year I decided to buy an alto saxaphone and have been learning to play ever since. I hope to learn the clarinet and guitar, and re-learn the piano to play better.</p>
